# Drifty By Example

This series of articles explains how Drifty works in simple terms. Our goal is to provide clear examples and visuals to make the core concepts easy to grasp.

## Introduction

Drifty is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) with a unique approach. It’s designed for everyday token holders, not just professional traders or institutional market makers. It helps community members provide liquidity with significantly less risk.

Our promise is simple: **if you provide liquidity to an active pool, you stand to gain, regardless of which way the token's price moves.**

-   When the price goes up, Drifty works to automatically cancel out Impermanent Loss (IL) over time. You can then exit your position with profits comparable to simply holding the token.
-   When the price goes down, you accumulate more tokens than you started with — perfect for long-term supporters of a project.

Drifty achieves this by blending concepts from modern CeDeFi and tailoring them to always benefit liquidity providers. You get the same easy "set-and-forget" experience as in Uniswap V1, but with returns that rival the most advanced DEX strategies in consistency.

## Features

-   **Automatic Liquidity Management**: No need to manually manage your position.
-   **Impermanent Loss Recovery**: The system is designed to recover your initial deposit, even if the token price rises.
-   **Dynamic Fees**: Earn more when traders are greedy and attract volume when the market is stable.
-   **Active Liquidity**: Your liquidity is automatically concentrated or relaxed based on market conditions to optimize earnings.
-   **Efficient Price Discovery**: Minimizes losses during periods of high price volatility.
-   **Single-Sided Liquidity**: Provide just one token from a trading pair.
-   **Limit Orders**: Buy and sell tokens at specific, predetermined prices.
-   **Infinite Scalability**: Supports pools that can handle billions of liquidity positions and limit orders simultaneously.
-   **Resilience**: Performs reliably during market manipulation and sharp price swings.
-   **Revenue Sharing**: Stake **$BURN** and provide liquidity in specific pools to earn 100% of the Drifty's fee revenue from almost all other pools.
